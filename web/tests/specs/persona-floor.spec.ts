/**
 * Actor skew guard (W7-08).
 *
 * Reads every tests/specs/*.spec.ts source file with node:fs at module load
 * (the same static-source-scan approach fullstack/protected-routes.spec.ts
 * uses for router.tsx) and counts literal `loginAs(<persona>)` call sites
 * per persona. This is a source scan, not a runtime trace, so it also
 * counts calls inside a `test.describe.skip` block (route-guard.spec.ts) —
 * deliberately: that file's matrix is real, reviewed coverage that simply
 * cannot execute until W6-S7 lands, and the alternative (deleting it, or
 * writing it with non-literal persona references) would either lose the
 * coverage or make it invisible to this guard.
 *
 * appAdmin dominated the suite (86/108 personas at the time this guard was
 * written, ~80%) because it is the path of least resistance: every spec can
 * reach for it and be sure nothing is denied. The floors below force real,
 * additional coverage of the roles the product actually ships — org admin,
 * org editor, reader, local admin and the zero-org case — rather than
 * papering over the ratio by relabeling existing appAdmin tests.
