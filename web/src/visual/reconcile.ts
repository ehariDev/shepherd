/**
 * reconcile.ts — W5-06: the pure projection CanvasPane's controlled React
 * Flow mode is built on, extracted so the reference-identity invariant it
 * depends on can be unit-tested without a DOM.
 *
 * --- The controlled-mode contract -------------------------------------------
 *
 * CanvasPane runs React Flow CONTROLLED: it owns the arrays React Flow
 * renders. That makes the ownership split something to honour explicitly,
 * because every way of getting it wrong is silent — no error, no warning,
 * just a feature that does nothing (see docs/reviews/canvas-framework-evaluation.md).
 *
 *   React Flow owns  `selected`, `measured`, `dragging`, and the handle bounds
 *                    it derives from them. These are written ONLY by
 *                    applyNodeChanges/applyEdgeChanges, from its change stream.
 *   The document owns node and edge existence, component, props, label,
 *                    position, disabled, notes. These are written ONLY by the
 *                    store.
 *
 * The functions below are the projection of the two, and they are
 * RECONCILED, never rebuilt. A node whose inputs are unchanged is returned by
 * the SAME REFERENCE. That is load-bearing rather than an optimisation:
 * `adoptUserNodes` runs with `checkEquality: true` and its fast path is
 * strict identity (`userNode === internals.userNode`), so handing it a fresh
 * object makes it re-adopt the node and throw away its cached handle bounds.
 * A version that rebuilt every node object on every render never hit that
 * path — which is why handles had to be re-measured by hand, and why simply
 * supplying `measured` broke connection dragging.
 *
 * Every "unchanged" check below therefore compares its inputs by REFERENCE
 * (`===`), never by deep equality: the store only ever hands out a new
 * `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge` object when that node/edge actually changed, so a
 * changed reference is authoritative even if a deep-equal check would call
 * the content the same.
