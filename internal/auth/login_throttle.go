// Local sign-in throttle tuning (D4, W3-2). Two independent buckets guard
// LocalLoginHandler: one keyed by the submitted login, one keyed by the
// source IP. Neither alone is enough — a per-login-only limiter lets an
// attacker spread guesses across many source addresses, a per-IP-only
// limiter lets one behind a shared address (the Helm ingress puts every
// client behind the same IP) lock everyone else out with a single
// misbehaving client.
//
// The per-login bucket is the tight one: burst loginPerLoginBurst attempts
// land immediately (an operator mistyping a password a few times must not
// see a 429), the 11th within the window does not. The per-IP bucket is
// deliberately generous for the same reason the risk is accepted rather
// than fixed here — behind the ingress every client shares one IP, so a
// tight per-IP limit would throttle unrelated users together; it exists to
// catch a single client hammering many logins from one address, not to
// replace the per-login bucket.

	// require consuming a reservation from a limiter that may not be the one
	// that actually tripped (IP vs login), and a slightly conservative fixed
	// value is a better contract for a client than a value that depends on

// its own share of traffic, a generous-but-real floor rather than an exact
// one — see D4, which chose this over a DB-backed counter precisely to avoid
// a write on every login attempt.
